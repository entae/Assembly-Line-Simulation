Milestones 1 and 2 were logically not too difficult to implement, but it took me a lot of time to ensure the behavior matched the output exactly.

Milestone 3 was much more complicated compared to the first two milestones. Especially the LineManager constructor. To make use of the STL functions, such as find_if, without using manual loops, lambda expressions were used instead. The deque library was also interesting to use, as it allowed for quick insertion into the array of station objects by using push_back function. However, it did also make it tricky to ensure I did not have any memory leaks while creating the constructor.
All these functions were crucial for initiating the m_activeLine and m_firstStation to allow the rest of the functions to properly handle the data related to each station. It was interesting to make use of STL algorithms which allowed for reduced errors to occur, but it also took a bit of time to look into and understand exactly how each function behaved.

After the logic of the modules in ms3 was achieved, it was another small hurdle to try and understand why the output was not matching exactly. I was not expecting to have to edit my previous modules as they had already passed the submissions. I ended up tracing my functions to see which functions were being called in the stack. 
I was then able to successfully fix CustomerOrder module, specifically the fillItem and display functions within this module.
As always, creating and implementing multiple parent-child classes was a tricky task, but the final result was very interesting to see and despite the initial trouble I had implementing the STL functions, it most likely helped to reduce more bugs than the bugs I encountered.
